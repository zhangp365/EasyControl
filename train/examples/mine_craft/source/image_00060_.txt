A young person stands playfully in a cozy library filled with tall shelves of books. They have long, flowing hair adorned with a flower accessory, and they wear a classic school uniform that includes a navy skirt and a white top with a sailor collar. The person has a cheerful expression, lightly resting one hand on their chin. Soft, warm light from nearby lamps casts a gentle glow, illuminating the wooden shelves and creating a welcoming atmosphere. In the background, various colorful books are arranged neatly, along with a few scattered items like small boxes and toys on the floor. The large windows allow natural light to filter into the space, enhancing the inviting feel of the library.
